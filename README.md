## Personal Learnings
- Time mananging CSS becomes incredibly important the more pages a site has
- If using SASS, any time you use a setting more than twice you should make a variable or mixin' for it to speed up your coding later
- Each page doesn't need its own template, but having a thorough understanding of how the tepmlates work off of each other is critical to having as little code as possible.
- How you lay things out becomes very different when you're using a CMS and are desinging for when clients may change things in the future.
- Flexbox does become easier the more you do it, mainly because you create the divs in your styling with it in mind!
